# BROWSER SESSION APPROACH (WORKING)
# =============================================================================
# Since the OAuth API is broken, we simulate browser requests. To set this up:
#
# 1. Log into Obsidian Portal in Chrome
# 2. Open DevTools (F12) -> Network tab
# 3. Navigate to your campaign's characters page
# 4. Click on any request to obsidianportal.com
# 5. In the Headers tab, find "Cookie:" and copy the entire value
# 6. For authenticity_token: View Page Source and search for "csrf-token"
#    or look for a hidden input named "authenticity_token"
#
# These values expire periodically - you'll need to update them when uploads fail.
