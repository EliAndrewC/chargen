# This file will eventually be used to generate art.  The prompts I use when
# generating prompts usually looks something like this:

"""
The PCs are talking to a samurai from the <clan name goes here> clan.

-> <he / she> is in <his / her> early <decade of age, e.g. '30s' or '20s', etc>

-> she is wearing <clan name> clan colors of <clan colors - see CLAN_COLORS in constants.py>

-> <I usually try to include some kind of detail relevant to who this NPC is, what traits they have, their position, their personality, etc>

Make a colored, photo-realistic, life-like rendering, matching the Legend of the Five Rings setting of Rokugan, based on Edo-period Japan with period-appropriate clothing and possessions being shown.  The background must be completely blank without any features.
